# Freight Eco-Routing
This repo contains pertinent files for the analyses performed in Pahwa, A., & Jaller, M. Can Truck Eco-Routing Bridge the Gap in the Transition to Zero-Emission?. Available at SSRN 4113893.

The analyses requires two tools,
- point-to-point routing tool to evaluate private impacts of eco-routing for the carrier hauling trucks
- multi-class traffic assignment tool developed using paired alternative segements (mTAPAS) to evaluate network-wide effects of system-wide freight eco-routing

The analysis and results from this work were presented at Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting - 2022.
