# Freight Eco-Routing
This repo contains pertinent files for the analyses performed in - Can truck eco-routing bridge the gap in transition to zero-emission? Pahwa and Jaller. Under Review (TRE). Pre-print version of this work is availabe at - https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4113893

The analyses requires two tools,
- point-to-point routing tool to evaluate private impacts of eco-routing for the carrier hauling trucks
- multi-class traffic assignment tool developed using paired alternative segements (mTAPAS) to evaluate network-wide effects of system-wide freight eco-routing

The analysis and results from this work were presented at Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting - 2022.
