# Freight Eco-Routing
This repo contains pertinent files for the analyses performed in "Can eco-routing be a stop-gap as freight mobility transitions to zero tail-pipe emissions. Jaller and Pahwa. Under Review". This analyses requires two tools,
- point-to-point routing tool to evaluate private impacts of eco-routing for the carrier hauling trucks
- multi-class traffic assignment tool developed using paired alternative segements (mTAPAS) to evaluate network-wide effects of system-wide freight eco-routing

This work is under review for presentation at Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting - 2022 at the time of this release. For post-publish version, see the latest release.
